		  <h2>Thoughts..</h2>
          <p class = "italic">
		  There was so much to do, but not enough time to do it all.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  My reading list kept growing and growing, but I never found the time to read the books that would help my business.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  On the rare occasion that I made time, spending hours reading a book kinda felt like an inefficient way to learn.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  I found that when I was teaching English, websites like Sparknotes were so valuable to those who didn’t have the time to read an entire novel.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Students could read great summaries, take the book’s key lessons and spend more time doing other things.
